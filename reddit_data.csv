128,Every Best Picture winner in chronological order by the date of their setting (this took a long time to do).,"This post is the title, basically, but I should make five things clear. First of all, a lot of winners take place over long periods of time, so I've noted just the beginning and ends of their main stories. Second, a lot of winners have frame stories or opening/ending scenes that aren't connected to the main story, which have been noted separately. Third, any overlap between years had a random order for the films (I decided not to get months-and-weeks specific. Fourth, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) doesn‚Äôt take place on Earth or conform to our timeline, so it isn‚Äôt listed here. Fifth, it's absolutely possible that I made a mistake, given how much guesswork I used for some of the films like Moonlight, so tell me if I did. Here's the list!:

Gladiator (2000)-180 to 192.

129,Showing nominee‚Äôs clips is very important during the Oscars ceremony,"The only thing that bothers me on the oscar ceremonies recently is that they dont present the nominees as detailed as before like for example upon presenting best screenplay, each nominated films show the script in courier print and there‚Äôs a voiceover then following it on the actual scene. One last example of this way of presenting was the last one hosted by Billy Crystal. The Oscars is just more regal and spectacular that way. It shows how they celebrate true genius behind the curtain. It‚Äôs one of the reason why loved these award shows ever since.

Remove all those kiss-ass pseudo-inspiring testimonies to the actors and replace them with clips. It‚Äôs what people wanna see. Especially this year where the movies are not mostly known by the general public. They need context therefore clips should be essential.

156,I Watched All 9 Best Picture Nominees So You Don't Have To (And You Are Out of Time Anyway),"Hey all! I‚Äôm back with some more reviews (√† la my reviews of [The Grudge Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/ekotvk/i_watched_the_entire_12_movie_backlog_of_grudge/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and [Makoto Shinkai‚Äôs filmography](https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/eq4ity/i_watched_all_7_makoto_shinkai_films_so_you_dont/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). This time I‚Äôm tackling all 9 of the Best Picture nominees this year! They all certainly have their merits and, in my opinion, represent one of the best slates on nominees in years. So, without further ado, here are my impressions of this year‚Äôs noms!

**1917**

I think it is somewhat redundant to say that there is a reason this is the film that is the favorite leading into the Oscars. I mean, it ticks all the boxes: it‚Äôs well directed, with a rare if not entirely unique style, a great albeit less-than-famous cast, it‚Äôs a period piece, and it‚Äôs ‚Äúbased on a true story.‚Äù In fact, it pretty much checks all the boxes that Academy voters have been voting on in the past 5-10 years, except one: this decidedly never feels like bait. From moment one, *1917* feels raw, real, emotional and epic. It is the quintessential ‚Äúgreat movie.‚Äù Unfortunately, it is also quite likely doomed to the same fate as many great movies: the recycling bin. It will probably be forgotten in all too few years and have its guts cut apart and repurposed for film school projects in the years to come. Which is sad, really, but it is the fate of so many of its contemporaries that it is hardly surprising. **9.7/10** **What it should win:** Best Cinematography **What it will win:** Best Picture, along with at least a few other awards

**Ford v Ferrari**

I mean, if there was a true underdog to this race it would be the completely fine but forgettable *Ford v Ferrari*. And that‚Äôs a shame, really, because even though it hardly deserves to be playing in the sandbox with the big boys this is ultimately a pretty decent movie. Amazing? No. But it brings something to the table that no other Best Picture nom this year manages: this is Oscar bait. Pure, unadulterated, Oscar Bait. The cinematography and acting and writing and story and period: it‚Äôs all what Academy voters lapped up for so many years, with all the fat cut down and any semblance of new ideas being drowned out by the sound of a Ford engine or Christian Bale yelling about his wrench. If this movie was released in 2009 or 2010 it may have a chance of winning. Nowadays, it‚Äôs destined to be left in the cold. **8/10** **What it should win:** Best Picture, 2009 **What it will win:** Probably nothing, but maybe a sound editing or mixing nod.

**The Irishman**

It might be because this is one of the films freshest in my mind‚Äîor more likely because *Goodfellas* is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time‚Äîbut I really enjoyed **The Irishman**. It suffers from some pacing issues and a team up of De Niro, Pesci, Pacino and Scorsese just screams ‚Äúbait,‚Äù but I feel as though overall the film never devolves into something you would expect. It, for one thing, never feels like it is trying to be a pretentious movie, just a director and a cast looking back on their lives and responding to the mistakes they have made. It feels in many ways to be a response to *Goodfellas* and *Silence*, a look at faith and mobsters in equal parts‚Äîthe two themes Scorsese has constantly been analyzing throughout his career. It‚Äôs long, bloated, confusing, dull, and has a distracting amount of CGI . . . but it is also probably Scorsese‚Äôs magnum opus. A real masterstroke. Now please let him retire from mob movies before he screws it up. **9.2/10** **What it should win:** Best Director **What it will win:** Unfortunately, unless somehow it pulls out a win in a technical category, *The Irishman* will likely be snubbed

**Jojo Rabbit**

This is probably about as anti-Oscars you can get, so it‚Äôs a pretty big marvel that it is even nominated for Best Picture. I mean, for one thing this is a satire‚Äîa historically difficult genre for both audiences and even filmmakers to understand. For another, this is a movie in which a young boy is imaginary friends with Adolf Hitler. It‚Äôs just not what usually draws the more, let‚Äôs say, ‚Äúuppity‚Äù Oscars crowd. All that being said, this movie is brilliant. Once you get used to the humor and the rollercoaster you are embarking on this ends up being one of the funniest movies of the year, if not the funniest. The cast is superb (I see great things in Thomasin McKenzie‚Äôs future) and there is not a single scene in this film that won‚Äôt have you grinning or crying. It‚Äôs, unfortunately, just not an Oscars film and is perhaps just a little ahead of its time to be truly appreciated. **9.5/10** **What it should win:** Best Adapted Screenplay **What it will win:** Again, save for an upset victory in a technical category, this film is destined to be snubbed

**Joker**

Ah, *Joker*. The movie that deserved most to be nominated but deserved least to win. I think it is really important that this film got the nods that it did, it is, after all, one of very few comic book films that actually take the topic seriously and with a lot of reverence both for its fan base and for the filmmaking community. It actually succeeded in creating a world in which we empathize, however morbidly, with *the Joker*. I mean, he is literally the face of pure evil. It also was fantastically acted and directed, with Joaquin Phoenix finally delivering a performance that forces the Academy to take notice of the otherwise fantastic but oft-overlooked actor. But, at the end of the day *Joker* will always be remembered with or without the Academy‚Äôs help, so I think the nomination is far more important than the award in this case. **9/10** **What it should win:** I might get flack for this, but I think *Joker*‚Äôs Oscars success should stop at Best Makeup and Hairstyling. Joaquin was great, but he has put in, and will put in, better performances in less contentious years **What it will win:** (Blegh) Best Actor

**Little Women**

I‚Äôm pretty biased in this because not only is *Lady Bird* one of my favorite films in recent memory, not only is Saoirse Ronan one of my favorite actresses currently rising in Hollywood, NOT ONLY are Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, and Eliza Scanlen great in their own right . . . but *Little Women* also happens to be one of my favorite novels. So I don‚Äôt think it was going to be any surprise that *Little Women* would also be one of my favorite films of this year. What Greta Gerwig did to this admittedly aging piece of fiction is beyond expectations, turning the provincial worries of the March family into gripping drama and some pretty heart wrenching moments. It transforms the almost 800-page novel into short vignettes, trimming off some of the less notable moments to showcase just the very best pieces and still managing to fully develop the characters and situations. It is, frankly, fantastic stuff. **9.5/10** **What it should win:** Saoirse Ronan for Best Actress, since Greta Gerwig was snubbed for Best Director **What it will win:** Possibly Best Adapted Screenplay, probably Best Costume Design

**Marriage Story**

Maybe it is because I had no expectations going into *Marriage Story*, but this was the biggest surprise for me across the entire slate of Best Picture nominees this year. It, on paper, seems pretty basic. Two people getting divorced, fighting for custody of their kid. But in reality, this movie just blew me away with how funny, dramatic, sad, and shocking it is. Adam Driver is beyond a standout: going in I literally thought of him only as Kylo Ren. From now on, I might actually see him as Charlie Barber because he steps into this role so naturally. It is also the only movie besides *Jojo Rabbit* on this year‚Äôs slate that honestly made me laugh. It is a small, insignificant, and otherwise unremarkable film but I loved it dearly. If the Academy gave awards purely on soul, *Marriage Story* would win them all. **9.5/10** **What it should win:** Best Actor for Adam Driver **What it will win:** I think it‚Äôs all but certain that Laura Dern has the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in the bag

**Once Upon a Time in Hollywood**

This isn‚Äôt Tarantino‚Äôs best work. There, I said it. If Tarantino deserved a Directing or Best Picture Oscar, he deserved it for *Pulp Fiction*, *Inglorious Bastards*, or *Django Unchained*, and I think it would be a pretty major disappointment if he won one for *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*. This is a bloated, confusing, incoherent, and ultimately plot-less mess of a film that ends up not leaving anywhere near as much of a mark on its audience or the cultural zeitgeist as its forebearers. It‚Äôs already on the forgettable side of Tarantino‚Äôs work and it hasn‚Äôt even been a year, there is no way that this film will last for the amount of time that so many of the director‚Äôs work has. Its only true saving grace is its actors: both Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio do admittedly terrific work, making the film at least as fun to watch as many of Tarantino‚Äôs other films. It‚Äôs just a shame that it doesn‚Äôt quite reach those heights. **8.5/10** **What it should win:** Honestly? Nothing. I think every category *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* is nominated in has better candidates for taking home the award. **What it will win:** Best Supporting Actor and almost certainly Best Original Screenplay

**Parasite**

This movie isn‚Äôt just the best movie of the year, it might very well be the best Best Picture nominee of the decade. That‚Äôs a huge statement, but, truthfully, I don‚Äôt think any other race in the 2010s has had a film so unique, well-written, well-crafted both from a production and directorial standpoint, and timely as *Parasite*. This movie just has so many quotable and talked about moments that have already entered the pop culture zeitgeist that it‚Äôs insane to think that it has only been less than a year since its release. *Parasite* seems destined to live on longer than any other film on this list, like the *Pulp Fiction* of the 2010s. But, just like *Pulp Fiction*, it won‚Äôt win Best Picture. It‚Äôs just to niche and the themes too controversial. But I think everyone who hasn‚Äôt watched this exemplarily piece of filmmaking should drop what they are doing and do so now. **10/10** **What it should win:** Best Picture **What it will win:** Best International Feature Film",f1i977,209,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars/comments/f1i977/i_watched_all_9_best_picture_nominees_so_you_dont/,2020-02-10 06:16:50,0.2710169832472737

253,"Serious question r.e. Will Smith/Chris Rock: Why is no one addressing Will's best actor/ ""apology"" speech read like straight-up ""abuser rationalizing"", with justifications like ""love will make you do crazy things""?! Then a standing ovation?? What message does the Academy send to DV victims??","Ok, so I am NOT writing this to start a stupid argument who is ""right"" in the Will Smith/Chris Rock Oscar affair, or whether Chris Rock went too far, or whether Will Smith's apology was real or sincere.  

On a more important level, though, I wonder:  How is it ok that (for whatever reason), a man was unexpectedly physically assaulted in a private venue in front of loads of people, and the person who assaulted him was not asked to leave, but instead made a speech in front of the Academy saying, (quote) ""love will make you do crazy things"" and ""I am overwhelmed by what God is calling me to do"", in order to justify that physical act of violence??!!  Then, to have an audience clap and give him a standing ovation as he won an award??!!  WTF did I miss here??!!  I don't care if Chris Rock was in the wrong and should have kept his dumb mouth shut - there is NO justification for getting physical with someone who is saying things you don't like, especially when you then justify it by saying that ""love will make you do crazy things""!!  

I feel especially triggered by this in two ways, as it hits really close to home.  First way is, I have survived domestic violence, and the absolute worst part for me was NOT the pain of being hit.  The worst was the way my abuser tried to justify hitting me, by saying things like ""what you just said to me really made me mad"" or ""it's because I love you so much.""  Later, after lots of therapy, I learned that these ""justifications"" are SO common in perpetrators of DV.  Imagine how many people out there in abusive relationships, much worse than what I  experienced, and looking for the strength to leave, the strength to believe that these justifications do NOT give people the right to abuse them....then imagine they are fans of Will Smith, or just anyone watching the Oscars that night, and seeing the standing ovation that Will received after saying those very same justifications?!  

The second way this hits close to home is that I suffer from another autoimmune disorder that is also notorious for having really bad physical effects on the body.  I have suffered and cried and mourned and tried to come to terms with this ""new me"" for the last 6 years, with my husband by my side.  And while I would be extremely angry and hurt if someone made a public joke at the expense of my illness, I still would be even MORE upset if someone used that as a reason (excuse) to physically assault someone.  I have had to deal with cruel people comparing my face, huge and swollen with edema from my illness, to a marshmallow, to being called a ""freaky' and so many other things horrible about my appearance post-illness (a lot worse than being compared to Demi Moore lol) and I haven't ever used this as an excuse for myself or my husband to make it physical.  

Ultimately, Will Smith (or any other person) is a human being, with faults and flaws and stupid choices.  He made the wrong choice in the moment, and he should take accountability - does not make him evil, or even an abuser, I'm not even trying to put that title on him at all.  But what about the Academy??  What is their responsibility??  They were the ones who chose not to remove him from the venue, to let him go on and make a speech, to address the audience in a certain way KNOWN to be used by abusers everywhere, and even give him an award and respect from his peers....What kind of a message are the ACADEMy giving to people living everyday with the possibility of that unknown and sudden ""slap"" coming your way because you said something wrong, or ""they love you too much""??",tqgxp9,139,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars/comments/tqgxp9/serious_question_re_will_smithchris_rock_why_is/,2022-03-29 00:45:52,-0.0506667439703154

255,The Oscars should NOT be a popularity contest!,"First, I have to qualify as a black woman, because some of my opinions would have you believe I was a white racist.

IMO, the Oscars have devolved into a popularity contest. They've been caving and catering to 'public opinion', instead of just picking the BEST of each category, REGARDLESS, and not BECAUSE of the actor's race, or situation, PERIOD.

No one should get an award simply because of color. I only ask that they stop nominating and choosing actors and actresses based on fear of backlash from the public. The tokenism should STOP. It's all because factions of the general public are so quick to assume that the reason a white actor wins over a POC actor isn't simply because of race, but a better performance. Anthony Hopkins was his usual masterful self in 'The Father'. He deserved it, NOT because he's white, and NOT because he already has ""enough"" Oscars, but because his acting is STILL master class.  This attitude of ""let someone ELSE havva chance"" is B.S. This isn't little league where you get something just because the other person already got one.

I LOVED Chadwick Boseman. I was looking forward to witnessing the rise of another black actor. I cried when I read about his death, BUT like I said, if Chadwick was legitimately the BEST actor in his catagory, dead, OR alive, then he should've gotten the Oscar. He wasn't, so he didn't. I've actually read comments from people pissed because they thought Boseman should've got it because ""He'll never be able to get one, again."" There is no ""sympathy"" category in the Oscars.

If I were an actor, the LAST thing I'd want is an un-earned award. It's tokenism, and it's insulting.",mz4ej4,140,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars/comments/mz4ej4/the_oscars_should_not_be_a_popularity_contest/,2021-04-26 23:58:48,0.11733870967741936

Amongst the other nominees her role probably had the widest range of emotions , ranging from devastating heartbreak to acceptance. All the buzz is being stolen by Carrie Mulligan and Frances against whom I have No animosity.  Her scenes with her husband, mother and the court are all impeccable. Still whether you agree or not she definitely deserves much more praise and appreciation.

257,Knives Out Snub,"Does anyone else think Knives Out was overlooked in several categories?

Right off the bat, Ana De Armas was phenomenal as Marta. She should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress, though I'm hopeful she gets her due this year in Blonde.

Daniel Craig was amazing, and though there were competitors in Supporting actor race, he wasn't even in the buzz other than the Globes. Maybe a win at the Globes would have helped him and Ana.

The production design was off the charts, and the costume was great, considering the contemporary setting. It definitely had better costumes than The Irishman, which I'm still confused why was nominated in this category.

The cinematography was actually very clever and crucial to the movie, and so was the editing. Score was good, but not phenomenal.

And it just occured to me that these films are the reason why there should be Best Ensemble category. Each of the cast played their role to perfection, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon and Chris Evans.

And finally, the big hit. It totally deserved a Best Picture nomination.Although i'm happy that it did get one nomination (the most deserving of them all) for screenplay, I can't help but notice that such witty, clever and contemporary films are grossly overlooked by the Academy.

Anyone else feel this? Feel free to disagree.

Edit: I agree that Ana and Daniel were leads. I just thought that in an ensemble movie most of the characters become supporting.Sorry for that.",fbgp1a,138,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars/comments/fbgp1a/knives_out_snub/,2020-02-29 23:55:16,0.3086394557823129

323,Chadwick Boseman‚Äôs Death is Not a Sympathy Award,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say that Chadwick‚Äôs win at the GG and hopefully Oscars is a sympathy award. They say that Riz Ahmed or Anthony Hopkins deserve it more. I hate that this is even a thing said. This is not a sympathy award because Boseman would still be a major contender without his death. Did his death help him winning? Yes, but if not for his death he would still probably fighting with Hopkins, it would just be a lot closer. I don‚Äôt hate that people think that there were better performances. I just hate that people say that Chadwick should not win. This is Boseman‚Äôs last shot to get some more recognition. The amazing thing about Boseman is that he influenced so many people with his performances in 42, Ma Rainey and especially Black Panther. He was a role model for people and children of all races and ethnicities and that‚Äôs why he is so amazing. He deserves this award because of his performances and the impact he left on so many people. And in that way, Ma Rainey is maybe his best performance. Watching it almost made me cry, and I don‚Äôt usually cry during movies. So, no, Chadwick‚Äôs win will not be a sympathy award but rather an award that will honor and support his legacy, leaving him to be remembered for years after that. Saying that they are only awarding it to him because of his death is ignorant. They are awarding him for his legacy and for his great performances.

400,I'm back with my Yearly Predictions (based on SCIENCE!),"Each year I predict who's going to win in the Oscars, but I have been using a statistical ""system"" that I've developed over the years (starting back in 2014!). The system has improved over the years and I believe this year's is the best yet!

[System's Oscars 2020 Predictions](https://i.imgur.com/QgD7IzW.png)

[Example of pie charts showing how the system calculates Best Picture](https://i.imgur.com/fd4hhUw.png)

The system uses a combination of award season wins and prediction websites and aggregates that data together to predict a winner. The difference between previous system versions and this year's is I've weighted each predictor based on how well they've performed in the past.

For example:

BAFTA winners predict Oscars winners 61.90% of the time.
Golden Globes winners predict Oscars winners 68.15% of the time.
Indiewire predict Oscars winners 68.90% correctly.
NY Film Critics Awards predict winners 22.75% correctly.
SF Film Critics Awards predict winners 36.65% correctly.

etc... The system can only improve as I add additional years into the weighting system, but for now I think it's still better than last year's version!",f0y92p,98,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars/comments/f0y92p/im_back_with_my_yearly_predictions_based_on/,2020-02-09 03:12:54,0.2756410256410256

David, your film is a masterclass. All your films are. You‚Äôre not only a master of the craft, you also have created some of the most nuanced and humanistic performances I‚Äôve ever seen.

455,Denis Villeneuve really deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Director,"Dune has gotten 10 nominations in Oscars today, most of them for technical categories. We usually see that with movies like Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Titanic, Mad Max Fury Road. All of these movies along with Dune had a phenomenal production that was pulled together and kept in balance by their great directors. 

Villeneuve has been one of the best directors working today and he made six insanely great films in the 2010s which is even more than beloved directors like Scorsese or Nolan. The 2010s has been his decade and even with a financial set back of Blade Runner 2049, he was still able to pull off a comeback with Dune which despite the pandemic and being released simultaneously on HBO Max was still able to become the 11th highest grossing movie of 2021. 

Nobody has been making a case for the theaters the way Villeneuve has this year, producing one of the greatest cinematic experiences that needs to be seen in theatres. Dune has the potential to go down as the next Lord of the Rings and I wish the Academy could at least acknowledge it with a nomination for Best Director. 

Villeneuve also deserves a nomination over Kenneth Branagh whose work in Belfast was fine and even over PTA. PTA has made phenomenal films like There Will be Blood or The Master but Licorice Pizza isn't the one for which he should rewarded over in terms of direction.",snm776,87,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars/comments/snm776/denis_villeneuve_really_deserved_an_oscar/,2022-02-08 20:28:19,0.32113526570048306

482,Would you want to see voting numbers for the Oscars?,"In basically every sports award under the sun voting numbers are released detailing the number of votes everyone got and the statistics on how close the race was. I would love for the Oscars to adopt this. You don‚Äôt need to assign a name and face to a vote but I would love to see the statistics on how close The King‚Äôs Speech and The Social Network were. Or how close Sam Mendes and Bong Joon-Ho were last year. It feels like they wouldn‚Äôt lose anything by releasing these numbers, so I don‚Äôt see what would stop them from doing it.",mwrqwj,82,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars/comments/mwrqwj/would_you_want_to_see_voting_numbers_for_the/,2021-04-23 15:21:46,0.25833333333333336
483,Where is the love for the great Paul Raci?,"I feel like Paul Raci is not getting enough praise for his performance in Sound of Metal.

In my opinion,  he not only deserves the Oscar for best supporting actor, but also merits more recognition for what was the most moving performance by any actor in any movie released last year.

There was something so unbelievably pure, profound, and compelling about his portrayal of Joe. It was almost transcendent.

All the other nominees put on great performances, especially Leslie Odom Jr in One Night in Miami. I thought both Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield were both great in Judas and the Black Messiah, but I'm little bewildered by the apparent consensus that's lining up behind Kaluuya. Putting aside the fact that both of these guys were ostensibly lead actors, I still don't feel they hit the same emotional register as Raci.

Give Paul the Oscar.

484,H√∫sav√≠k deserves to win Best Original Song,"Yes, I realize I‚Äôm effectively arguing for a Will Ferrell movie to win an Oscar, but hear me out:

First, H√∫sav√≠k is a genuinely good song. It‚Äôs uplifting and makes me borderline nostalgic for a place I‚Äôve never even visited. It captures a human condition that connects us to our roots, and delivers it with a passion that I envy. But, above all else, it serves an important narrative role in the film itself; it‚Äôs a turning point and epiphany for the most empathetic character‚Äôs story arc, marking the climax of the movie. This makes it an integral part of the film, which wouldn‚Äôt work without this song. 

It‚Äôs really good, and I hate‚ÄîHATE‚Äîthat people are comparing it to Borat‚Äôs Wuhan Flu. (Maybe these people haven‚Äôt actually heard it?)

There‚Äôs no doubt that the other songs up for nomination are in better movies, but they‚Äôre (unless I missed it) all end credits songs that, in my view, contribute little to the films they were commissioned for. And for that reason, I genuinely want H√∫sav√≠k to win.",m8ugi5,83,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars/comments/m8ugi5/h√∫sav√≠k_deserves_to_win_best_original_song/,2021-03-20 05:14:26,0.30234374999999997
