considered to be the most accurate and up to date?",175,v3nmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v3nmn/my_wife_doesnt_want_to_vaccinate_our_child_and_im/,785,1339779040.0,"EDIT #2: Wow. There are quite a few people on here calling my wife and I idiots, morons, assholes, scum; we should kill ourselves, CPS should take our child away.

Look, she may not be a genius rocket scientist, but she tries to do what's best for our child. Actually, the reason I'm doing this is *because* she cares so much for our child that I'm certain she'll do whatever is best. If everyone here's right, then she'll gladly vaccinate once I've read up on it's pro's vs cons, and presented it to her. The problem is that she's gotten scared by a couple websites and books, and as some of you may know, it is a scary issue. Nobody here can deny that children have died minutes after receiving a vaccine.
It got her spooked.

I love her for being such a caring mother, and I know we'll do the right thing.

When I see other people raise their kids, most times I shake my head.
 
""My 2 year old just loves McDonalds and Pizza hut."" 
""Ah, you know what, breastfeeding is such a hassle, I'm gonna go with formula!!""
""Let's give him a pacifier; who cares about speech impediment or warbled teeth? Make the crying stop!!""
Etc, etc...

So I'm not really impressed with the ways of the herd, so to speak, which is why to me this isn't a simple no-brainer.
We are thinking and researching every step of the way to do right by our child, and this is one of many decisions we have to make. Thanks to everyone who submitted anything of substance, it is much appreciated and will probably result in increased herd immunity.

ORIGINAL POST: My wife is scared and the books she reads and lectures she watches are often criticized for statistical cherry picking, logical fallacies or even fear mongering.

Pro-vaccine arguments are said to be 'bought' by Big Pharma.

I want to hear the other side of the story, by reading a highly acclaimed and peer reviewed book that paints a different picture of vaccines and their benefit to our child's well being and safety.

EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions! Me and my wife aren't as crazy as some of you think, I'm just looking for avenues for further investigation, and insults don't bother me in the slightest when compared to my child's well being.

Here's what we got so far, thanks again!!
