And while some of these articles are easily and freely accessed, you're likely going to have to go to a library that has a subscription to access a number of them (unless you want to pay $35 for a PDF).

In terms of stuff that's freely available, [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018252/?tool=pubmed) is a review of epidemiologic studies of a link between thimerosol and autism from the Journal of Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics. Here are two excerpts that cut to the heart of the matter.

>In particular, inappropriate recommendations by autism advocacy groups27 regarding treatment of autism (e.g., use of chelation) and avoidance of vaccines (e.g., influenza vaccine) may mislead parents to place children at unnecessary risks. Treatment of autism with chelation therapy that has not been identified as efficacious or safe presents unnecessary risks for children with autism. In addition, avoidance of vaccination leads to an unnecessarily increased risk of infections, hospitalization, and death

and

>Although immunization provides important benefits to public health, associated risks are inevitable. However, studies have consistently failed to identify a cause-effect relationship between thimerosal and autism. In addition, the prevalence of autism has increased despite a decrease in the thimerosal content of vaccines; this finding further suggests that there is not an association between thimerosal and autism but that the increased prevalence of autism may be attributable to improved diagnostic criteria and increased awareness of autism.

There's also a look into the history of the controversy from the American Journal of Public Health [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376879/?tool=pubmed).

Please take the time to look over these resources. There has been no study which legitimately showed a link between vaccines and autism; the original paper that kicked off all of this, published in the Lancet by Andrew Wakefield has [been retracted](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/02/lancet_wakefield_autism_mmr_au.html) after the General Medical Council found that Wakefield had acted dishonestly and irresponsibly, and the twelve years of research into the subject since that paper's publication had shown key claims to be flat out incorrect. 

Of course, I'm assuming the objection is a purported link between vaccines and autism, as that's the most common complaint. Hundreds of studies (available as references in the linked review) have shown that there's no link there, but that *not* vaccinating is opening up the child to a whole lot of risk of contracting an easily preventable and potentially life threatening disease, as well as reducing herd immunity which is responsible for protecting people who can't (or aren't for whatever reason) vaccinated, as well as those for whom the vaccine wasn't effective (as vaccines aren't 100% effective, just like everything else in the world).",t3_v3nmn

The stuff about autism linked to vaccines was debunked. Google articles about infant deaths from preventable diseases. It's not pretty. I have worked in health care and trust me, even if vaccines did cause autism I would still vaccinate because autism is better than dead. If she is worried about potential reactions ask the pediatrician to do bloodwork to verify there are no unknown infections that could already be working the immune system. A simple cold can cause a child to become sick with high fever and vomiting after an infection but that IS preventable. And keep the child in the doctor office for 45 minutes following the vaccines to watch for potential allergy. Then if there is an allergy it can be dealt with immediately. Any allergic reaction after that time frame is highly unlikely to be serious but should still be reported immediately. Again, your child is still safer with vaccines than without. I am on my phone so posting article links is not possible for me as my connection is fucking horrible but google ""child death from pertussis"" or ""child death from pneumonia"" or ""child death from chicken pox"".

19,c513ung,t3_v3nmn,"I'm not a parent but I can sympathize with the constant fear and uncertainty from having a little one's well-being in your hands. However, if you choose to parent based on what's scariest out in the world, you're going to be an irrational and quite frankly, a bad parent. Because everything in this world has risks. How your child was delivered posed a risk to its health. What food you feed them. What medication for tummy aches you choose. Where you live. The materials your house is built from. 

The fact of the matter is vaccines have their drawbacks but their benefits greatly outweigh the risks. Here are some debunking of popular anti-vaccination arguments:

* **Modern sanitation and diets make our children strong enough to naturally fight off the diesease**

That is completely speculation and conjecture. We have no idea how a modern, developed country will handle a large scale outbreak. We only have history to give us clues which is why so many people are scared shitless. As late as the 50s/60s, we had people suffer from these diseases and ended up dead/maimed/crippled.

>  [In the United States, the 1952 polio epidemic would be the worst outbreak in the nation's history, and is credited with heightening parents’ fears of the disease and focusing public awareness on the need for a vaccine. Of the 57,628 cases reported that year 3,145 died and 21,269 were left with mild to disabling paralysis.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_poliomyelitis)

* **Modern medicine can intervene if the child actually does get exposed to the disease**

Modern medicine can only do so much. For example, polio, mumps, measles, and whooping cough have no cures. The best that even modern medicine can do is monitor the patient, treat symptoms, and lessen the severity/duration of the disease.

Which is highly unfortunate since these diseases are generally extremely painful and agonizing to go through. Whooping cough causes body racking that can actually fracture ribs and cause hernias. The coughing fits can seem endless to the patient and many end up vomiting at the end of each fit. They can have multiple fits in an hour and the disease can last for weeks. Statistics favor survival but it is a horrible experience to have to live through. Many of these diseases cause extremely threatening side effects that can cause permanent damage such as secondary infections and inflammations. In that scenario, the patient has to fend off another disease after being severely weakened by the first one.

We do live in a modern age of wonderful medical advancements. However, there has been little investment into finding better treatment for these diseases because the best treatment still is preventative by getting vaccinated. 

* **Vaccines cause autism**

Researchers devoted to researching autism still have yet to come up with a definite cause for autism. One week it's because of something that happened in the womb, another is because it's genetic, then it's environmental, and on and on. Since the disorder encompasses a whole spectrum, the causes are probably multiple and complex.

Vaccination schedules coincide with the first awareness of autistic symptoms. Parents say they saw a change in their child's development after they got vaccines. Or they say, their child didn't developed like they thought they would. Again, that's conjecture. There's no definite way to extrapolate how a child develops based off prior developmental markers. Which is why each developmental marker is assessed individually and doctors say, ""Your child SHOULD develop normally based off this current marker,"" and not, ""Your child WILL develop normally based off this current marker.""

Autistic symptoms that are missed during early infancy become much more pronounced as the child ages. Most people aren't entirely concern if their 3-month-old isn't responding to social stimuli because they think the baby is being fussy, uninterested, grouchy, etc. However, when your toddler doesn't have any verbal skills, can't look you in the eye, or doesn't respond to conversation, you realize, ""Oh no, something is wrong.""

Last but not least, Dr. Andrew Wakefield was collaborating with a lawyer who wanted to bring a class-action lawsuit against the MMR manufacturers. They started out the study hoping to find dirt on the vaccine so they can make a lot of money. To ensure this, they used unethical methods. Although the research didn't conclusively prove anything, Wakefield basically announced to the whole world that the safety of the MMR vaccine was questionable and set off the whole modern anti-vaccine movement. After his unethical behavior came to light, he lost his medical license and the journal retracted the study.

84,c518xca,t3_v3nmn,"As a mother of three, I shared your wife's concerns when I had my first son.  (In the interest of full disclosure, all of my children are completely up to date on their vaccines -- influenza shots as well as standard course.)  I did consult with my doctor about skipping the OPV (live polio) in favor of the IPV -- however, the OPV was discontinued from the standard sequence by the time firstborn was due for it.  We had an aquaintance whose child contracted polio from the OPV.  Our ped skipped the rotavirus vaccine the first time around -- it was pulled soon after -- my second and  third received it six years later -- a new formulation.  My advice is to find a pediatrician you trust -- and listen to them.

To be fair, vaccines are scary even to an adult who _knows_ how tiny the risks are.  As a mom, especially with a firstborn, _everything_ is new and scary.  The first time my son received four vaccines at once he cried nonstop for eight hours (every second he wasn't nursing). I think his legs were sore and crampy.  At the 4 month checkup we decided to split the vaccines up -- 2 that day, 2 a week later.  That worked fine.  We staggered the 'bulk' vaccines across a week up to a year old.

Things happen -- daughter, six years later, had a reaction to the 2 month vaccines as well.  She ran a sky high fever and wound up at the ER late on a Friday night.  None of the tests turned up anything, but the docs wanted us to give her antibiotics for the entire weekend (required two more trips -- one to ped on Sat morning, one to children's hospital on Sunday).  She is fine -- after that I decided that vaccines happen earlier in the day (8:30 a.m. appts) and earlier in the week. 

My final suggestion is -- _vaccinate_ your child.  It's not always easy, it's definitely scary, and takes time and is painful for both mother and child. But, a few rough days/hours across the first years of life is nothing compared to watching a truly sick child suffer.  There are enough horrible, scary, unpreventable illnesses out there without adding in the ones that can be prevented.

How about reducing the argument to this:   if a child has a vaccine he *might* have a one in several million chance of an adverse reaction of any significance.  If the child doesn't have the vaccine, once he's exposed he has a significantly high probability of ending up in the emergency room or dead.  Which odds sound better to you?

In my grandmother's generation about half the kids died before their 5th birthday.  You're probably too young to remember seeing people crippled for life from Polio (and it's because of vaccines that polio is unheard of now in the US).   Mumps, measles, rubella, and whooping cough are all HORRIBLE illnesses and can be fatal.    If the wife is still unsure, show her videos of beautiful babies in the ER or in ICU horribly sick with any of these infectious diseases.    No child needs to suffer like that.  I beg you to please trust proven medical science.

Just remember that anyone can write a book, but it takes a scientists 4 years of undergrad, 2 years of masters, 4 years of a PhD, 10+ years of experience, and 3 years of research on a specific subject before publishing, and it gets reviewed by people who have put in just as much time in his field. And let me tell you, the scientific community are really hard on eachother when it comes to publishing in a top-notch journal. Compare this to a guy who shows up on CNN or a writes a book.

133,c51bcpo,t3_v3nmn,"This is Reddit, so you're getting reamed for bringing up anything remotely anti-vaccine. I hope the message hasn't been so vitriolic that the important points fail to make an impression. 

I am mom to two boys. My sons are vaccinated. However, like you, I was nervous about vaccines - specifically the number of shots they get between newborn and age  two.  I don't debate the efficacy of vaccines, and I don't buy into the 'causing autism' argument, but I fear that being bombarded with eight or more vaccines at once has been a 'trigger,' perhaps, for children who are otherwise predisposed to the condition. 

I read Dr.Sears' Vaccine Book, which explains each vaccine, and most importantly helps you put together an alternate schedule so that baby receives no more than one or two at a time.  It takes a bit longer, and may result in a few side trips to the doctor outside of well-baby visits, but it can give you peace of mind (as well as allowing you to see the reaction to one shot at a time, in case of allergic reaction). 

I can't remember our personal schedule off the top of my head, but I know we started with DTaP and polio as two vaccines that have a long track record for safety.  They were well past age two when we started the MMR series - something they usually start between 12-18 months;  at the time it was the height of the autism hysteria and I wanted them to be at the point where they were talking well so that any personality changes would be evident.  We declined the Hep B series that they try to start mere hours after birth - we just stated that we preferred our pediatrician give all vaccines and we got no grief from the hospital.  (Hep B is not transmitted easily like whooping cough, etc - we waited until the year before they started school to start this six-month long series, finishing in August before school started.)  

We managed to skip rotavirus entirely (they only give it before 6m so they aged out of it - I stalled because this was around the time children were getting intestinal problems that they linked definitively to a version of this vaccine).  They received everything else on the modified schedule before they started any kind of preschool - we were done by age 3 for my older and 2 1/2 for the younger. 

It is important to have a doctor who understands, who won't ""fire"" you for refusing the combination vaccine. Our pediatrician is actually a DO rather than an MD, which may make her more open-minded to begin with, but she never gave us a hard time and ALWAYS was able to get the individual shots for us (some drs claim it's impossible and only stock the combo shots).  She'd see my kids for regular checkups where she'd give one shot, then we'd go back in for a 15 minute slot the next month just for another separate vaccine. 

You do have to be considerate while you're catching up, as far as exposing others.  However, if you're reasonably working toward full vaccination, an alternative schedule isn't putting your baby at much more risk, nor is it causing more risk to the ""herd"". Almost every vaccine at this age is a series where full immunity is only achieved after 2-3 shots, so ALL babies under a certain age, even if vaccinated on schedule, are still potential carriers for vaccine-preventable disease. Your baby would only be weeks behind as far as that goes.

139,c515815,t3_v3nmn,"I think just educating yourself on the individual illnesses would be important. People focus on the risks of a vaccine, but the illnesses involved are much riskier, learn about those. There are vaccines now for some forms of meningitis. Meningitis is fucking horrific.

 Since so many people have gone full-retard on this issue, those illnesses are around more nowadays, which just sucks and makes it even riskier for those who are not vaccinated. Since some of those who don't have vaccines don't have a choice due to health issues, we really need everyone else to be immune to protect them (it's called herd immunity). Even if your kid IS 100% healthy, those illnesses could still make him or her seriously ill, leave them disabled, infertile or dead. It is safer to vaccinate. 

Another thing to consider is that sooo many people have had vaccines, and lots of them. In the UK the NHS manages to vaccinate most children. If these vaccines were so dangerous we'd probably see some evidence of that by now. Oh ya and I trust that the NHS isn't 'bought' by 'Big Pharma'. While I'm sure there are financial pressures, the NHS is good at taking the cheap route. That's vaccination. Why? Because it's safe, and safer than getting that particular illness. We tend not to vaccinate for things that a person is not at risk of getting, it tends to be the easily spread childhood illnesses.

**Mumps and Measles Vaccines are Also Failing**

**Mumps:** In 2010, more than 1,000 people in New Jersey and New York were also sickened with mumps. In the US, children typically receive their mumps vaccination as part of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises children to receive their first dose between 12 and 18 months, and their second between the ages of 4 and 6.

This vaccine is supposed to improve immunity to measles, mumps and rubella… yet 77 percent of the 1,000+ who came down with mumps were vaccinated. Similarly, in 2006, when mumps infected more than 6,500 people in the United States, cases occurred primarily among college students who had received two doses of MMR vaccine. At that time, just about the only people who were truly immune to mumps were older Americans who had recovered from mumps as children, and therefore had received natural, lifelong immunity.

**Measles** – The 1989 measles epidemic in the region of Quebec was largely attributed to incomplete vaccination coverage – until a study9 into the outbreak disclosed that the outbreak occurred in a population that had 99 percent vaccination coverage. The researchers concluded that: ""Incomplete vaccination coverage is not a valid explanation for the Quebec City measles outbreak.""",t3_v3nmn

Beforee you freak out, let me tell you that he's super healthy, 12, and since he lives with me now and she's far away I can probably get him dpt/mmr this week before he goes to her house and she'll never know.


But here was her point, and i'd like a civil response -I believe research shows that for the baby's health, vaccines should be given later, up to a year or more later. However, the cdc made a decision that the only point of access for most babies is right after birth/in the first year, because many don't see a doctor again for years. They must, from a public health standpoint, quash any discussion of WHEN to vaccinate because of the larger social principle/herd immunity. 


I think the idea that vaccines are given too early is the strongest critique, and the fact that we live in a large, pluralistic society makes that a cdc necessity, but not necessarily a parent's necessity.

-**Pen and Teller** just recount scientific discussions and scream ""Bullshit"" when they find something that doesn't have evidence. You can find more valuable research in articles specifically discussing the science of vaccines.

-**The Seth Mnookin book** is an enormous waste of time.  He is a writer, not a scientist, and the purpose of that book is to draw emotion and fear out of the reader, not to educate or provide real evidence.

Also, as to the people calling you names for asking questions, please ignore these people.  They are just as dumb as Jenny McCarthy in a different way.  Ask your questions, get your answers, and make your decision.  You don't need to take the input of assholes to do any of those things.",t3_v3nmn

Both sides have some valid points and both sides are full of shit. 

1. The government has no right to put anything into our bodies. If you fundamentally believe this, MOVE TO CHINA. 

2. You cant have your kids taken away for not vaccinating. Its called a religious or philosophical exemption, and most states have them. 

3. The Vaccine Book by Dr. Sears is a great middle of the road book. It has a delayed/selective schedule for parents that want to take it slow. I think your wife would respond to this way better than all the list of zealous scare tactics you have. 

There is a lot to consider when vaccinating. If you want to make an informed decision regarding each disease/vaccine consider the following. 

1. Name of the disease
2. Description of the disease
3. Length of time from initial infection to end of all symptoms
4. Infectious period
5. Normal symptoms of the disease
6. Known serious consequences of the disease
7. Proportion of persons infected developing serious consequences
8. Transmission route of the disease
9. Prevalence of the disease
10. Treatments of the disease and efficacy of those treatments
11. Relevant research about the disease
12. Name of the vaccine
13. Company that makes the vaccine
14. Contents of the vaccine
14A. The significance of whether or not the vaccine is live
15. History of development of the vaccine
16. Known side-effects of the vaccine and rate of incidence of those side-effects
17. Possible side-effects not yet acknowledged by the vaccine maker
18. Relevant research into the vaccine
19. How effective is the vaccine at preventing the disease?
20.What is the vaccine meant to do? (Many vaccines are not meant to prevent infection or transmission).
21.Number of cases reported each year.
22.Number of deaths reported each year from the vaccine and natural disease.

259,c515vol,t1_c511c7d,"I got whooping cough as an adult. It is TERRIBLE. I honestly thought I was going to pass out literally every night for two months. It is by far the worst disease or illness I've ever had. Heck I have sleep apnea and have to wear that stupid breathing mask thing EVERY SINGLE NIGHT and I wouldn't go through a 3-month period of whooping cough to fix that problem.

Imagine this scenario: You wake up in the middle of the night, like you have every night for the past three months. You can tell that ""The Cough"" is coming, like it has every night for the past three months. Like it has every day for the last three months. You try to stop the urge- you really do, like you can sometimes stop a sneeze, but you can't stop this cough- it's DEEP in your lungs. So you try to get a little cough to stop the urge, but that doesn't help. You try another little cough, and another, and soon you can't stop coughing. You cough and cough and cough some more. After building up to body-shaking coughs that you literally cannot control, your throat muscles start to constrict, since they've been blasting at full force to try to cough up what you have in your chest. They then close together with only the tiniest of air holes left. Your body literally strangles itself. At this point, you still have to cough. So you do- now your lungs are out of air, and your throat is closed tightly. What to do? Try to breathe in- it's all you can do. As you gasp for air your body goes into fear-response mode and panic sets in, as it's harder than breathing through a straw- more like one of those tiny coffee stirring straws. Oh, did I mention that it physically hurts to breathe in? You're pulling so hard with your lungs it feels like they may collapse, and air rushes past your raw (remember the coughing?), dry throat. This makes a horrible, moaning noise (hence the name). After about 15 seconds, you have maybe 1/4 of your lung capacity filled. Ah but don't forget, you still need to cough! So you do. You breathe that air in but you can't even hang onto it, so you cough it back out. Immediately. You don't get to hold your breath and maintain SOME level of oxygen... no, you just blast it back out, because the kicker is you can breathe out just fine- just not back in! This process repeats several times, with you trying to breathe in but just coughing it right back out. You start to pass out. Now, when you cough, your diaphragm is spasming so hard that you vomit. Now not only can't you breathe but you're throwing up too, so you have to worry about not breathing water. After a few minutes of this, you FINALLY rid yourself of the demon itch/urge to keep coughing. You wipe the vomit and sweat from your face and clean up the bathroom. Again. Like you did for every night for the last 3 months. They call it the 100 day cough and they don't exaggerate. 

The kicker? Doctors can't do squat for you. The problem is, as I understand it, the disease ravages your lungs before your body can fight it off. Your body does fight it off though, but by that point your lungs look like a battlefield, and it takes your body three agonizing months of hell to repair everything.

I was a previously adult with plenty of access to healthcare- the docs could do virtually nothing for me. I could not imagine subjecting a child to this torment for fear of ""big pharma"".

> Modern sanitation and diets make our children strong enough to naturally fight off the diesease

>That is completely speculation and conjecture.

Worse, we have real-world examples to the contrary.  Ireland didn't vaccinate for measels until 1985.  In 1985, they had about 100,000 cases per year.  By 1987, they had 200.  1/1000 of these people die, on average, in developed countries.  One hundred lives per year saved, and tens of thousands avoid serious illness.

""Prior to the 20th century, virtually all children were infected with PV while still protected by maternal antibodies. In the 1900s, following the industrial revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, improved sanitation practices led to an increase in the age at which children first encountered the virus, such that at exposure children were no longer protected by maternal antibodies [132].

Pre-European contact Alaska was home to a wide range of Native American tribes. There was the Inuit/Yupik in the north, Aleut in the west, Athabaskan in the interior, and Tlingit and Hiada in the south. This is an oversimplification, but it works. These people existed much like the Native Americans in the lower 48.

First European contact was in the 1730's with Russian explorers. What followed was very similar to what happened to native Americans in the continental US. Basically death, enslavement and the loss of everything they had.

The European explorers brought diseases with them that AK natives had no experience with. Diseases like TB, measles, mumps, whopping cough and other illnesses ravaged the villages. My grandmother contracted TB. She was lucky enough to survive. 90% of her family was not. This amounted to hundreds of people dead, just in one family.

The diseases came quickly after the settlers and were always a problem. A race you may have heard of called the Iditarod actually began because people were trying to get TB medication out to the villages. At some points in history it got so bad that native towns went into self imposed quarantine. No one was allowed near the villages, and anyone who tried was shot.

TB and other diseases remain a problem in rural Alaska. We have the third highest rate of TB in the country, and outbreaks are common. Sorry about the novel, but I hope I answered your question!",t3_v3nmn

These are the parts of your statement that I have the problem with.  Do you have any evidence, any at all, that this approach is actually causing people to vaccinate in larger numbers?  Do you have any evidence at all that approaching parents, who are on the fence about vaccinating, by verbally attacking them is a valid method of solving this problem?

I'll answer that question for you: No.

Call up the Australian Vaccination Network or the NVIC... two non-profit organizations known to peddle sub-scientific information on vaccination. Be nice, and ask how much in donations they received 10 years ago vs how much they receive today.  Then tell me that this approach of calling parents ""Idiots"" ""Irrational"" ""Stupid"", and any other combination of demeaning words, is working.  

Call up Alex Jones and ask him what his net worth is.

Skepticism is failing and, as I said, skeptics are doing little more about the problem than shouting at the rain.

Meanwhile. the anti-vaccination movement continues to expand.  Your logic has failed.  Time for a new approach. That's what I'm trying to get started.

Obviously, it's not as though you can *directly* link outbreaks to people stopping vaccination, but lower vaccination rates will decrease herd immunity, which is important especially in the case of whooping cough as many adults don't get the booster shots, and the immunity only lasts for about a decade.

I am not saying vaccines cause autism like alot of anti-vaccine people because the evidence isn't there in my opinion. However, I don't see the evidence that vaccines do what they are supposed to do. If a vaccine is supposed to protect you then why do people get the diseases that they are protected against? Herd immunity is the answer I always get. Herd immunity is less than before so those diseases are making a comeback. Unfortunately I don't buy that. Believe me I wish I did. It would make everything easier but that isn't the case for me. I am not scared of whooping cough, measles, the flu, or the chicken pox. I haven't had a vaccine since I got out of the Army. I haven't been sick since I got out of the Army. I was sick every year for the almost eight years I was in the Army yet I was vaccinated up the wazoo while in the Army. Correlation doesn't prove causation so I cannot say with absolute certainty that the vaccines got me sick. But I also cannot say with absolute certainty that the vaccines didn't cause me to get sick. 

Take the pertussis ""epidemic"" (if you can call less than 1% of the population an epidemic) in Washington state. It began in the Skagit county health department with a bunch of people who were correctly vaccinated and now the most affected group is 10-13 year old, who guess what were vaccinated against pertussis. What does the state recommend? That the booster date needs to be moved up. What if the answer is that the currenct vaccine for pertussis does not produce the desired results?

509,c518s18,t1_c516olw,"An example for you.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles) are all quite nasty (though not usually fatal) infections. Fortunately, for us, they are very uncommon in the developed world. We vaccinate against these diseases (this is the MMR vaccine). Since the vast majority of people are vaccinated, even if one person gets, say, mumps, it's unlikely to spread very far, because nearly everyone who could be infected is already immune to it. Hence, outbreaks are rare, and when they do happen, they tend to be self-limiting. This is herd immunity.

I was only partially vaccinated against these 3 diseases as an infant; at that point it was a 3 shot course, and since I had a severe adverse reaction to the first, I didn't get the others. I may or may not have had some level of immunity to these diseases. (In fact, I later learned that I didn't; when you join the military blood is drawn to test for antibodies, so they can vaccinate anyone without immunity to any of the diseases that are vaccinated against, and I had no antibodies for any of the 3. I got the vaccine as an adult and am now protected, yay me.)

So why didn't I get any of these 3 diseases, all of which have been historically common until vaccination began? Herd immunity. Because these diseases can't spread when the vast majority of the population is vaccinated, I was never exposed to them, so I never even had the opportunity to be infected.

Now, what happens when people don't vaccinate? Herd immunity is compromised. You may think ""well, even with this whole no-vaccine hoopla, the vast majority of people are still vaccinated, right? So why does it matter?"" Well, it takes a surprisingly small proportion of the population being susceptible to disease to allow the disease to spread. Especially in an urbanized society where you're in contact with lots of people, a small change can make a big difference. Pulling numbers out of my ass, but a change from 99% immunity to 95% immunity can mean the difference between an outbreak stopping at a handful of individuals and an outbreak spreading through a large portion of the unvaccinated population. 

As far as the actual numbers, it's going to depend on the characteristics of the particular infection - its virulence, or rate of transmission; transmission mode - airborne, by physical contact, sexual transmission, through fecal matter, etc.; detection rate - rubella, for example, is often nearly asymptomatic in children, so they're more likely to be out and about spreading the disease than if they had mumps, which causes rather obvious and painful symptoms in children; and statistical wizardry.

TL;dr: So that's herd immunity. A large enough proportion of the population is immune, and an infection can't spread far past its ""patient zero"", because there's not enough people who are susceptible to the infection for it to spread to. Fall below that proportion, and the infection can and will spread throughout the unvaccinated population. Voluntarily not vaccinating your children lowers the proportion, potentially exposing not only them but also all other unvaccinated people to infection, when they previously would have been safe.",t3_v3nmn

Now, lets say that Jane is in Mary's class. Jane couldn't get a vaccination for (insert whatever here) because of an allergy to one of the ingredients. Regardless of the fact that her parents wanted her to get it. Mary's little infant brother does not have the allergy but he is still a few months away from being old enough to get whatever vaccine. 

Now,Johnny's parents are with Mary's Mom on this whole no vaccine thing. They did their research. They know its all a ploy by big pharma and god forbid their child have an autism spectrum disorder. Everyone knows vaccines cause that. Just like Down's Syndrome. 

Well, Johnny's Dad has to go to Some random non-herd vaccinated county for business. He comes back a little sick but it doesn't seem that bad. Now Johnny is infected from a horrible and entirely preventable illness but he doesn't know that yet. 

Oh no! Mary and Johnny are cousins and visit each other on Sunday.  Johnny is contagious and doesn't know it. Now they are both sick. Mary goes to school Monday not realizing she has whatever-horrible-disease and is contagious.  Now Jane is the only other un-vaccinated kid in her class. 

Now, Jane gets sick and goes home and infects her little brother who was too young to get the vaccine. 

Johnny gets better. Mary and Jane develop lifelong ailments. Jane's infant brother dies a horrible death his parents had to watch.

There are a number a variables that can play into an outbreak of pertussis, including the storage of the vaccine itself

That's entirely possible, but it's difficult to see how avoiding vaccination can *help* in a pertussis outbreak. I hadn't seen the potential link between improper vaccine storage in Washington and their outbreak, but if that's the case, it's that the vaccine is rendered ineffective, so that the recipient is effectively unvaccinated. If that's the case, it's a factor that decreases herd immunity *in addition* to voluntarily avoiding vaccination; the unvaccinated population would simply include those who chose not to vaccinate and those who were vaccinated but it didn't take because the clinic stored the vaccines improperly.

It should go without saying that when one is speaking in favor of vaccination, they're speaking in favor of *effective* vaccination, where the vaccines are stored and used properly and there's a system to ensure that's the case. 

And, as I said, immunity to pertussis wanes. [Here's](http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs015/1102992250985/archive/1108938610829.html) an article about Lake County that's from last year, rather than four years ago; it makes the same point. Because immunity among adults tends to wane without a booster shot, if anything it would seem to be *more* important to vaccinate and you've got what amounts to a large non-immune populations walking about.

>data suggests the vaccinated individuals are the main source of the outbreak

Vaccinated, but not necessarily immunized.

>More study may be needed.

Well, yes. More study is always needed. Vaccines must be rigorously studied, kept up to date, inspected and regulated. No one is arguing otherwise. My point was not to blame outbreaks in their entirety upon the antivax movement, but avoiding vaccination is a factor that can only exacerbate the phenomenon.

Whilst this may be true for you, this is not the view commonly held within the reddit community.  I haven't read all of the responses to OP's post, however, the vast majority of the ones I have read were hostile, degrading, and abusive.  Most in this forum that speak out with regards to vaccinations already have their torches and pitchforks in hand every time an outbreak of infectious disease occurs (or attempts to do a vaccine risk/benefit analysis).  Causation is rarely even so much as an afterthought.  They **just know** every outbreak is due to the few unvaccinated individuals - despite ample evidence of infectious disease outbreaks and transmission within the vaccinated.  

An unwarranted fear of individuals that opt out of vaccinations for themselves, and their families, has developed.  At the same time, many believe vaccines are a panacea for disease prevention.  If it were only that simple.

Having 75% of inspected vaccine samples considered potentially damaged (and 25% expired) suggests many medical professionals have become extremely lax in the handling of vaccines.  Blaming the few that opt out of the system for every outbreak is irresponsible and is certainly not based upon science.  There is little evidence that any of the recent outbreaks of pertussis in the country originated within the unvaccinated community.  Empirical evidence suggests otherwise.

In normal situations where everyone else is also vaccinated, the bulkhead (vaccine) can easily protect your body from any disease that may get to you.
However, if you are awashed in a sea of vaccination people raging with the disease. The total weight of disease coming at you can overwhelm your bulkhead and you can still get the disease. ",t3_v3nmn

You don't think it's implied that vaccines should be handled properly? I can't really speak for Reddit as a whole; all I can do is speak for me.

>I haven't read all of the responses to OP's post, however, the vast majority of the ones I have read were hostile, degrading, and abusive. 

That's true, and I've posted in my prior responses that he should ignore the insults as asking for information isn't a bad thing. Internet anonymity being what it is, though, you're going to get that.

>They just know every outbreak is due to the few unvaccinated individuals - despite ample evidence of infectious disease outbreaks and transmission within the vaccinated. 

The vaccinated, but not-immune. Unvaccinated individuals don't help; it's merely a question of whether they're a large enough portion of the population that they're extending chains of infection such that the disease can more easily reach the vaccinated-but-not-immune. 

>An unwarranted fear of individuals that opt out of vaccinations for themselves, and their families, has developed. At the same time, many believe vaccines are a panacea for disease prevention. If it were only that simple.

It's not a panacea, but vaccination at least allows for the potential of becoming immune. If the vaccines aren't being handled properly, you can't really blame that on the vaccinated. They're taking steps to try to become immune, and it's ineffective (which means they're relying on herd immunity, which breaks down for a number of reasons; among them the unvaccinated). 

>Having 75% of inspected vaccine samples considered potentially damaged (and 25% expired) suggests many medical professionals have become extremely lax in the handling of vaccines.

It suggests that medical professionals in at least one state have become lax; they should be inspected, reprimanded and forced to handle medicines properly. It doesn't necessarily speak to a nationwide issue (it may, but doesn't necessarily); obviously, this should be investigated.

>Blaming the few that opt out of the system for every outbreak is irresponsible and is certainly not based upon science. 

What you're suggesting is that vaccines don't necessarily result in immunity; this is a risk inherent to vaccination, but it's not as though unvaccinated individuals are *helping* the situation. The very best they could be doing is not making it worse, but given that there *are* outbreaks, they're at as much a risk of being infected and spreading the disease as the vaccinated-but-not-immune. There's a chance they're making things worse.

>There is little evidence that any of the recent outbreaks of pertussis in the country originated within the unvaccinated community.

The question isn't where it originated, but how it can be contained. It doesn't matter where the diseases start; they're (with the exception of a select few in the United States, like polio and smallpox) around and it's possible to pick them up, so the real question is how to limit the number of people that get the disease. It can't be contained by unvaccinated individuals; they have no defense against pertussis and are more likely on an individual basis to contract and spread the disease than a vaccinated individual. You haven't provided any empirical evidence to suggest they're somehow capable of breaking chains of infection which would lead to reduced outbreaks. The best solution, it would seem, is to vaccinate and hope that the vaccinated individuals who are immune act as a firewall between those who have the disease (for whatever reason) and those who don't, but aren't immune (either because the vaccine didn't take or because they weren't vaccinated).

The problem is that in all of these cases involving outbreaks in places with high vaccination rates, we don't know how bad the outbreak would be with low vaccination rates. There were 138 cases of whooping cough in Lake County last year (which works out to just under 20 per 100000 residents, as there's 700000 people in Lake County). It could be that that number would be *much, much* higher if their vaccination rate were significantly lower, but we don't know because that's not the case right now. Non-immunized people spread the disease and maintain the infectious agent within communities, so it's hard to see how it could be lower.

Part of the problem in breaking down the population is that the vaccine only lasts 5-10 years. Adults who haven't had the vaccine since they were kids are effectively unvaccinated, and I'm not sure it makes sense to lump them into the ""vaccinated"" group, as they're out of date on their vaccinations and by electing not to renew them, might be more properly considered voluntarily unvaccinated.

If nothing else, this conversation reminded me it's been about six years since my last Tdap booster, so I should probably get on that.

In all of my responses in this thread, I've acknowledged that vaccines have a (small) inherent risk, and that you're basically just managing that risk; the choice isn't between the risk vaccines present and complete safety; it's between the risks vaccines present and the much greater risk we'd be facing if we didn't have vaccines.
